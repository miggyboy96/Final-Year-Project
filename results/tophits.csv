Very similar to BAM2,with more than 85% a.a. identity. It has a broad expression pattern and is involved in vascular strand development in the leaf, control of leaf shape, size and symmetry, male gametophyte development and ovule specification and function. Anthers of double mutants (bam1bam2) appeared abnormal at a very early stage and lack the endothecium, middle, and tapetum layers. Further analyses revealed that cells interior to the epidermis (in anther tissue) acquire some characteristics of pollen mother cells (PMCs), suggesting defects in cell fate specification. The pollen mother-like cells degenerate before the completion of meiosis, suggesting that these cells are defective. In addition, the BAM1 expression pattern supports both an early role in promoting somatic cell fates and a subsequent function in the PMCs.

No changes were observed after treatment with 50?M ABA. It is localized in the nucleus via a nuclear localization sequence located in the fourth conserved region of the C-terminal B3 domain. HSI2 is also an epigenetic repressor as it also contains functional plant homeodomain-like (PHD-L) and zinc-finger Cys- and Trp-containing (CW) domains associated with epigenetic regulation. The PHD-L domain of HSI2 is connected to promoting trimethylation of Lys-27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3), while the CW domain can bind directly to H3K4me3. Through these domains, HSI2 represses the seed maturation program during seed germination by repressing transcription of the core LAFL (LEC1, ABI3, FUS3, and LEC2) seed developmental transcriptional regulators. In developing A. thaliana embryos, HSI2 suppresses expression of a large number of genes, many identified as targets of FUS3. However, the absence of HSI2 had no effect on transcript levels of the LAFL regulators and the levels of measured metabolites and phytohormones (ABA, auxin, and JA derivatives) in developing Arabidopsis embryos. HSI2 likely fine-tunes seed maturation by repressing genes involved in early embryogenesis that are not required later for seed maturation and desiccation.","AT2G23290",4.6174484112403e-06,-2.12824351674505
