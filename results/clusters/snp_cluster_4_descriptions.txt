AT5G27740	AT5G27740.1	A locus involved in embryogenesis. Mutations in this locus result in embryo lethality.	protein_coding	EMBRYO DEFECTIVE 2775 (EMB2775)	EMBRYO DEFECTIVE 161 (EMB161);EMBRYO DEFECTIVE 2775 (EMB2775);REPLICATION FACTOR C 5 (RFC5);EMBRYO DEFECTIVE 251 (EMB251);REPLICATION FACTOR C 3 (RFC3)	
AT4G00990	AT4G00990.1	jJumonji-domain-containing H3K9 histone demethylase. Loss of function mutants are susceptible to bacterial infection and early flowering.	protein_coding	JMJC DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 27 (JMJ27)	JMJC DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 27 (JMJ27); (ATJMJ17)	
AT3G08720	AT3G08720.1	Encodes a ribosomal-protein S6 kinase. Gene expression is induced by cold and salt (NaCl).  Activation of AtS6k is regulated by 1-naphthylacetic acid and kinetin, at least in part, via a lipid kinase-dependent pathway. Phosphorylates specifically mammalian and plant S6 at 25 degrees C but not at 37 degrees C. Involved in translational up-regulation of ribosomal proteins.	protein_coding	SERINE/THREONINE PROTEIN KINASE 2 (S6K2)	ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA PROTEIN KINASE 2 (ATPK2);SERINE/THREONINE PROTEIN KINASE 2 (S6K2);ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA SERINE/THREONINE PROTEIN KINASE 2 (ATS6K2);ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA PROTEIN KINASE 19 (ATPK19)	
AT5G48070	AT5G48070.1	putative xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolase, expressed primarily in the stele of mature non-elongating regions of both the main and the lateral root.  Is expressed in lateral root primordia but expression ceases after lateral root begins to grow. Involved in cell proliferation in incised inflorescence stems.	protein_coding	XYLOGLUCAN ENDOTRANSGLUCOSYLASE/HYDROLASE 20 (XTH20)	XYLOGLUCAN ENDOTRANSGLUCOSYLASE/HYDROLASE 20 (XTH20);XYLOGLUCAN ENDOTRANSGLUCOSYLASE/HYDROLASE 20 (ATXTH20)
